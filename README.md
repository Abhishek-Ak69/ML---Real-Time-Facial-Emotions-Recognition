Understanding human emotions is key area of research, as the ability to recognize one’s
emotions can give one access to a plethora of opportunities and applications, ranging from
friendlier human-computer interactions, to better targeted advertising campaigns, and culminating
with an improved communication among humans, by improving the emotional intelligence of
each of us. While there are multiple ways one can investigate the recognition of human emotions,
ranging from facial emotions, and posture of the body, speed and tone of the voice, in this paper
we shall focus on only one area of this field - visual recognition of emotions. One of the reasons
we chose to focus on the area of facial emotions is because certain facial emotions have universal
meaning, and these emotions have been documented for tens and even hundreds of years.
“Constants across cultures in the face and emotion”. Our Project will six key emotions: anger,
disgust, fear, happy, sadness and surprise. These are the same emotions that are being use d by
current researchers to identify facial emotion in computer vision, or in competitions such as
Kaggle’s Facial Emotion Recognition Challenge, along with the addition of a seventh, neutral
emotion, for classification.

using deep learning (a VGG- 16 convolution network, a ResNet50
convolution network, DenseNet, MobileNetV2, ) to identify these seven main human emotions .
To us this problem is extremely relevant because of its broad spectrum of applicability in a variety
of fields, such as systematic recruiting, while being also able to be integrated with a variety of
technologies (i.e. smart glasses, VR, wearables, etc.).
